## Project Description, the Soundgood Music School
The purpose is to facilitate information handling and business transactions for the Soundgood music school company, by developing a database which handles all the school's data and also an application that can handle some of the transactions.

Building a database without structure will most likely end up failing or being extremely bad. In this project the author will structurally build a database for the Soundgood music school. The author solved the task by building a conceptual model, logical model and then translating it to SQL code to create the database itself. The database can perform various of different tasks such as managing the schoolÂ´s instruments, lessons, students, and instructors. A command line interface will be developed to manage some aspects of the database. The author will be discussing and motivating each step of designing the database and how each step of the project was solved.

### Intended Learning Outcomes
#### Task 1, Conceptual Model
- Model needs for information based on an organizational description and convert the model to a functioning database.

#### Task 2, Logical and Physical Model
- Model needs for information based on an organizational description and convert the model to a functioning database.
- Use relational databases and query languages.

#### Task 3, SQL
- Use relational databases and query languages.
- Describe and explain basic concepts, principles and theories in the area of data/databases/data storage and in information administration and database design

#### Task 4, Programmatic Access
- Describe how a program can access a database and write such a program.

### Discussion
The purpose of the task was to implement and represent information handling and business transactions for the Soundgood music school. By following the different sub tasks the author was able to structurally design a database which can manage all the different business goals. Even when designing the database in the structurally way the author still needed to go back to the first/second task and redesign the Conceptual Model and Logical Model. This was because when implementing the different business tasks the logic did not work as indented. But because the task was solved in a structurally way it was easy to go back and change and update the model and the database.
